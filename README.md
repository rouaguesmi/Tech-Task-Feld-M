## Installation Guide
Please make sure that a python version >= 3.5 and pip are installed in your machine. <br />
if not, you can download them from this link : [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). <br/>
In task 5 we used the external library psycopg2, you can install it, by running the following command in a terminal (or cmd for windows): <br />

`pip install psycopg2`

In <b> task 5 </b> an installation of <b> PostgreSQL </b> server is required. 
According to your operating system, follow the provided link for installation instructions : <br/>

* <b> [Windows](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/) </b>
* <b> [Linux ](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-linux/)</b>
* <b> [Mac OS ](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-macos/)</b>

## utils.py Module

In order to avoid code duplication and centralize used functions in multiple tasks, I created the module utils wich contains the following functions :<br/>
```
* def connect_and_execute_query(sql_query: str) -> list: 
```
This function will connect to the provided SQLite database and execute the sql query passed in parameters. <br/>
The function will return a list containing the result of the sql query execution. <br/>

```
* def extract_exchange_rates(file=EUROFXREF_XML, currency='USD') -> dict:
```
Function used in task 2 in order to extract exchage rates from the provided xml file. <br/>

```
* def find_day_with_most_revenue(result: list) -> tuple:
```
Function used in task 2, it will process the result of a sql query in order to find the day with most revenue created by mobile phone users.<br/>

## Task 1 to 4

Each script contains a solution for the given tasks. 
E.g task1.py contains a function named task1_solution() wich contains the script to solve the task. <br/>
To run each script, use following command in a terminal from the project directory :

```
Python task1.py
``` 

## Task 5 and transactions.py module

In order to add support to other DBMS, my solution is to create a class that abstracts the database manipulation : connection, disconnection, sql execution, ect. 

The class TransactionsDBManager constructor takes into parameters the database type : 'sqlite' or 'postgres' in our case.

After that, the class will allow the user to manage the two types of databases in the same manner.

In order to demostrate the utility of the class TransactionsDBManager <br/>
I used it in task5.py to do the following tasks : <br/>

1/ Copy the transactions sqlite database into a postgres database. <br/>
2/ Solve task 1 with postgresql and sqlite databases using two objects of the class TransactionsDBManager
