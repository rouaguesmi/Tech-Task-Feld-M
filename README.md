## Utils module

In order to avoid code duplication and centralize used functions in tasks 1 to 4, I created the module utils wich contains the following functions :<br/>
```
* def connect_and_execute_query(sql_query: str) -> list: 
```
This function will connect to the provided SQLite database and execute the sql query passed in parameters. <br/>
The function will return a list containing the result of the sql query execution. <br/>

```
def extract_exchange_rates(file=EUROFXREF_XML, currency='USD') -> dict:
```
Function used in task 2 in order to extract exchage rates from the provided xml file. <br/>

```
def find_day_with_most_revenue(result: list) -> tuple:
```
Function used in task 2, it will process the result of a sql query in order to find the day with most revenue created by mobile phone users.<br/>

## Task 1 to 4

Each script contains a function named task1_solution() (for task 1) wich contains the script to solve the task.
To run each script, use following command in a terminal from the project directory :
```
Python task1.py
